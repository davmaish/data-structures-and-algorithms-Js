APPLICATIONS OF DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

1️. ARRAY

WHERE IT IS APPLIED.

Storing collections of data (marks, prices, user IDs)

Databases (rows of records)

Image processing (pixels stored in 2D arrays)

Algorithms Used

Linear Search

Binary Search

Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort)


REAL APPLICATIONS.


Microsoft Excel (stores data in tabular format)

Image processing software

Data analytics tools


WHY IT IS USED.


Arrays allow fast access using index numbers (O(1) time complexity), making them efficient for storing and retrieving structured data.


2️. STACK (LIFO)

WHERE IT IS APPLIED.

Function calls (Call Stack)

Undo/Redo operations

Expression evaluation (compiler design)

Algorithms Used

Push and Pop operations

Depth First Search (DFS)


REAL APPLICATIONS


Web browsers (back button history)

Text editors (Undo/Redo)

Programming language execution


WHY IT IS USED.

Stack follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO), making it ideal for nested operations and memory management.


3️. QUEUE (FIFO)

WHERE IT IS APPLIED

CPU scheduling

Print queue systems

Task scheduling in operating systems

Algorithms Used

Enqueue and Dequeue

Breadth First Search (BFS)

REAL APPLICATIONS.

Printer spoolers

Customer service systems

JavaScript Event Loop (callback queue)


WHY IT IS USED.

Queue follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO), ensuring fairness in processing tasks.


4. LINKED LIST

WHERE IT IS APPLIED

Dynamic memory allocation

Music playlists

Browser forward/back navigation

Algorithms Used

Insertion

Deletion

Traversal

REAL APPLICATIONS.


Spotify playlist management

Browser session management


WHY IT IS USED

Linked Lists allow dynamic resizing and efficient insertion/deletion without shifting elements.


5️. TREE

WHERE IT IS USED.

File systems

Database indexing

DOM structure in web development

Algorithms Used

Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)

Binary Search Tree operations


REAL APPLICATIONS.


Windows File Explorer

MySQL database indexing (B-Trees)

HTML DOM structure

WHY IT IS USED.

Trees represent hierarchical relationships efficiently and allow faster searching in structured data.

6️. GRAPH

WHERE IT IS USED.


Social networks

GPS navigation systems

Computer networks

Algorithms Used

Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Breadth First Search (BFS)

Depth First Search (DFS)


REAL APPLICATIONS.


Google Maps (shortest path calculation)

Facebook friend network

Internet routing systems


WHY IT IS USED.

Graphs model relationships between entities and are ideal for solving connectivity and path-finding problems.
